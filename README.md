# SFML-FlappyBird
Flappy bird clone, and game engine created using SFML and C++. Created using tutorials from Sonar Systems

While I typed, slightly modified and provided some resources for this code, it was completed through tutorials uploaded by Sonar Systems

I used these tutorials to better my understanding of how to properly create a game engine, and to learn about some more complex aspects of C++
